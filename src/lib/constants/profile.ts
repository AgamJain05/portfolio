  about: `
Right from the start of my undergrad, I've been that person who says, "Why not build it myself?"—which led me to discover my passion for building full-stack web and mobile applications that solve real problems.
These projects reflect my core belief: great software should solve small, real-world problems—and do it beautifully. I'm especially drawn to building scalable, SaaS-based solutions that bring long-term value.

Along the way, I've strengthened my practical experience through internships at:

Vigility Technologies, where I built a React.js-based reporting frontend integrated with a FastAPI backend—optimizing performance and delivering a responsive, data-driven UI.

Cognizant, where I engineered Java-based backend modules, automated build processes, and optimized SQL operations—applying core software engineering principles in a real-world business context.

With 600+ LeetCode problems solved and a solid grasp of data structures and algorithms, I write clean, efficient code with a strong product-first mindset.
